project 1 : ðŸš€ DevOps Project 1 - Automated CI/CD Pipeline in Action!
Excited to share my first hands-on DevOps project where I built a fully automated CI/CD pipeline using:
Git Bash for local development
GitHub for version control
Jenkins for continuous integration and automation
What I Built:
Set up a Jenkins job with a 1-minute polling trigger
Created and pushed basic & test files from Git Bash to GitHub
Jenkins automatically:
Builds a new Docker image
Deletes the old container
Launches a new container
Pushes the updated image to Docker Hub
All of this happens without manually opening Docker terminal or VM â€” end-to-end automation achieved!
This project gave me a clear understanding of CI/CD principles, job configuration, Gitâ€“Jenkins integration, and Docker automation.
Grateful for the continuous learning experience!
